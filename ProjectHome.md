LucidDB is the first and only open-source RDBMS purpose-built entirely for data warehousing and business intelligence. It is based on architectural cornerstones such as column-store, bitmap indexing, hash join/aggregation, and page-level multiversioning. This project uses the native LucidDB jdbc driver & builds the managed wrapper around it to make it possible to work with LucidDB from .NET & Mono applications.

There are still many things should be done to consider this provider fully finished, but it' it's already mature & stable enough to query the database, insert / update / delete the data.

For usage examples, please see included test files.
